## Authentication

Metamapper uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/) for authentication. Tokens have a default TTL of 24 hours.

### Overriding the Authentication Middleware

Authentication is handled via Django middleware. By default, Metamapper uses the [django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/middleware/#module-django.contrib.auth.middleware) class. This should be used in the vast majority of cases.

You can disable authentication by setting the following environment variable:

```
METAMAPPER_AUTHENTICATION_MIDDLEWARE=app.authentication.middleware.AnonymousAuthenticationMiddleware
```

You can also use your own custom middleware if you want specific authentication logic, such as restricting authentication to certain emails or [using headers provided by a load balancers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html). We'll have some examples up here soon.

## Encryption

Sensitive information, such as database passwords and authentication tokens, are encrypted at rest using [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/) symmetric encryption. This guarantees that sensitive variables cannot be manipulated or read without access to the encryption secret.

You define the encryption secret via the `METAMAPPER_FERNET_KEY` environment variable.

### Generating a Fernet key

If you need to generate a new fernet key you can use the following code snippet.

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
fernet_key = Fernet.generate_key()
print(fernet_key.decode())
```

### Rotating encryption keys

No standard support yet, but we're working on it.

## OAuth Authentication

Metamapper supports [single sign-on out](workspace-management--sso-introduction) of the box for generic SAML2.0 applications. No extra configuration should be necessary â€“ just set up your connection as suggested in [this guide](workspace-management--sso-saml2).

If you want to enable OAuth authentication via Google and/or Github, follow the respective guide below.

### Google Setup

If you want to use Google OAuth to authenticate users, you need to issue credentials via Google Cloud Platform.

First, sign into the [API manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?pli=1) and create a new project. Once you have done that, you can create a new set of OAuth credentials. You should use the "Web application" type and give it a recognizable name.

The callback URL should be set to: `${METAMAPPER_WEBSERVER_ORIGIN}/oauth2/google/callback`.

Once created, you will have access to the client ID and client secret. Set these in your `.env` file:

- `METAMAPPER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (Google OAuth Client ID)
- `METAMAPPER_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (Google OAuth Client Secret)

If the environment variables have been updated properly, you can go ahead and restart the webserver process (e.g, `docker-compose up -d webserver`). Once enabled, you should be able to set up a Github connection using [this guide](workspace-management--sso-google).

### Github Setup

You will need a Github organization to set up Github OAuth to authenticate users. You will need to create an OAuth App, which can be done from your organization settings.

The callback URL should be set to: `${METAMAPPER_WEBSERVER_ORIGIN}/oauth2/github/callback`.

Once created, you will have access to the client ID and client secret. Set these in your `.env` file:

- `METAMAPPER_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` (Github OAuth Client ID)
- `METAMAPPER_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (Github OAuth Client Secret)

![github-oauth-secrets](/img/github-oauth-secrets.png)

If the environment variables have been updated properly, you can go ahead and restart the webserver process (e.g, `docker-compose up -d webserver`). Once enabled, you should be able to set up a Github connection using [this guide](workspace-management--sso-github).
