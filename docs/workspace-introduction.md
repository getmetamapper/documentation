Welcome to the **Workspace Management** section of the documentation.

## What is a workspace?

A workspace is an isolated environment within Metamapper. It is a group of datastores that can be administered together. You can invite team members to your workspace with varying permission levels to control access to specific resources.

You can use workspaces to separate environments such as production versus staging. Or you could use a workspace to isolate specific data assets from parts of your organization.

> **Note**: There are plans to add object-level permissions to Metamapper in the near future.

## Deleting a workspace

You can delete a workspace from the **General** tab of the **Workspace Settings** page. This will permanently delete the workspace as well as all of the data associated with your workspace.

It will never delete any data from your connected datastores.
