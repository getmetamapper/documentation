You will prompted to choose a connection type:

Once you select Google, you will be re-directed to the Google authentication page. Choose the account with the domain that you want to authenticate. If authentication worked, you will be redirected to the screen shown below. Confirm that the domain and default role is correct and click the **Save Changes** button.

That's it! You should now be able to set your default connection to the connection you just created.
